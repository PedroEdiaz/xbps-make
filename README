xbps-make: Minimal Package Builder for XBPS
===========================================
A lightweight, POSIX-compliant Makefile wrapper to automate building packages 
for the XBPS package manager (used in Void Linux). Designed for developers who
want a simple, scriptable interface to streamline package builds without 
complex tooling.

Features:
	- Minimal dependecies (coreutils, xbps, bmake, git, curl, sed, tar, gzip)
	- Declarative build system
	- Hackable for other package managments
	- Rebuilds only when necessary

Usage:
	bmake devel/tcc.src   # download source
	bmake devel/tcc.xbps  # build and make package
	bmake clean           # clean build directory if failed

Options:
	MAN=no                     (Do not install manuals)
	POSIX=no                   (Do not install posix complice options)
	BUILDDIR=path              (compile .src on path)
	CACHEDIR=path              (save .src on path)
	XBPSDIR=path               (save .xbps on path)

Warning:
	* This proyect it's used with bmake, other posix make programs
	haven't been tested, but it should work, feel free to adapt it
	if needed.
	* GNU make doesn't work because the "include" command work 
	diferent than posix make "include" command.
